Jetpack Layouts
======================
In this codelab, I learned how to use Compose's highest level of UI abstraction, Material Design, as well as low-level composables like Layout that allows you to measure and place elements on the screen.

If you want to create a Material Design-based UI, Compose has built-in Material components composables that you can use. If you don't want to use Material Design or want to build something that is not in the Material Design specs, you'll also learn about how to create custom layouts.
